# TankU-LLM
A large language model specifically trained for low-resource languages

objective:

This LLM is designed to be a flexible tool for generating language practice materials for any given language with minimal resources.
This project combines a chatbot function for training on real-world inputs with language mapping algorithms trained on a variety of contexts
The AI will center its learning around assigning a series of info tags to each word. The software contained herein is meant not to be the ultimate decoder of dying languages, but rather a tool that would allow a few dedicated linguists to generate large amounts of material in their native language.

variables:

language profile:

language name:
language family: Niger Congo, Indo European, Afro-Asiatic, Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, Trans New Guinea

contextual:

year of publication:
demographics of speaker and intended listener(s)
purpose of the writing: informative, entertainment, persuasive
topic classes relaated subclasses:
presentation type: novel, epic, poetry, free association, informative essay, scientific literature, screenplay, skit, short story, song, conversation, etc.

word characteristics:

phonemes
part of speech
definition(s)
connotation

phrase dictionary:

every topic should have an associated glossary set of probable words and co-topics

Step 1 
Parse passages by word length and choice

find all spaces
extract strings from between spaces to get words

compare strings to glossary
possibly add corrections for mispellings

t


step 2
parse by phonemes and groups thereof
take IPA phoneme inventory and rewrite the article so one sound gets one symbol, inserting IPA figures to patch over ambiguities



relate word choice to distance in passage
compare new data with a bank of translated training data
send translations to language team for vetting
Add vetted translation to training data and calculate the error rate.
